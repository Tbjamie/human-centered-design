          Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, “Ecce Homo,” “The
          Antichrist” is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may
          be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their
          final form. Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to
          have constituted the first volume of his long-projected magnum opus,
          “The Will to Power.”
        </p>

        <p>
          His full plan for this work, as originally drawn up, was as follows:
          Vol. I. The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of Christianity.
          Vol. II. The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a Nihilistic
          Movement. Vol. III. The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality, the Most
          Fatal Form of Ignorance. Vol. IV. Dionysus: the Philosophy of Eternal
          Recurrence.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first sketches for “The Will to Power” were made in 1884, soon
          after the publication of the first three parts of “Thus Spake
          Zarathustra,” and thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up
          notes. They were written at all the places he visited on his endless
          travels in search of health—at Nice, at Venice, at Sils-Maria in the
          Engadine (for long his favourite resort), at Cannobio, at Zürich, at
          Genoa, at Chur, at Leipzig.
        </p>

        <p>
          Several times his work was interrupted by other books, first by
          “Beyond Good and Evil,” then by “The Genealogy of Morals” (written in
          twenty days), then by his Wagner pamphlets. Almost as often he changed
          his plan. Once he decided to expand “The Will to Power” to ten
          volumes, with “An Attempt at a New Interpretation of the World” as a
          general sub-title. Again he adopted the sub-title of “An
          Interpretation of All That Happens.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, he hit upon “An Attempt at a Transvaluation of All Values,”
          and went back to four volumes, though with a number of changes in
          their arrangement. In September, 1888, he began actual work upon the
          first volume, and before the end of the month it was completed. The
          Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity.
