        Save for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, “Ecce Homo,” “The
        Antichrist” is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may
        be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their
        final form. Notes for it had been accumulating for years and it was to
        have constituted the first volume of his long-projected magnum opus,
        “The Will to Power.” His full plan for this work, as originally drawn
        up, was as follows: Vol. I. The Antichrist: an Attempt at a Criticism of
        Christianity. Vol. II. The Free Spirit: a Criticism of Philosophy as a
        Nihilistic Movement. Vol. III. The Immoralist: a Criticism of Morality,
        the Most Fatal Form of Ignorance. Vol. IV. Dionysus: the Philosophy of
        Eternal Recurrence. The first sketches for “The Will to Power” were made
        in 1884, soon after the publication of the first three parts of “Thus
        Spake Zarathustra,” and thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up
        notes. They were written at all the places he visited on his endless
        travels in search of health—at Nice, at Venice, at Sils-Maria in the
        Engadine (for long his favourite resort), at Cannobio, at Zürich, at
        Genoa, at Chur, at Leipzig. Several times his work was interrupted by
        other books, first by “Beyond Good and Evil,” then by “The Genealogy of
        Morals” (written in twenty days), then by his Wagner pamphlets. Almost
        as often he changed his plan. Once he decided to expand “The Will to
        Power” to ten volumes, with “An Attempt at a New Interpretation of the
        World” as a general sub-title. Again he adopted the sub-title of “An
        Interpretation of All That Happens.” Finally, he hit upon “An Attempt at
        a Transvaluation of All Values,” and went back to four volumes, though
        with a number of changes in their arrangement. In September, 1888, he
        began actual work upon the first volume, and before the end of the month
        it was completed. The Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative
        activity.
